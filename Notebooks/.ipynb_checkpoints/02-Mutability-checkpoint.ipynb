    "# Mutability\n",
    "\n",
    "You will encounter the term **\"mutable\"** and **\"immutable\"** while reading/discussing Python. Essentially, this means whether an object can be modified/mutated. For example, integers are immutable: you cannot change the number 1 to mean anything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept is important at a fundamental level, particularly with regards to dictionaries. The key-value structure of a dictionary is essentially what is called a **\"hash table\"** or **\"associative array\"**. These are common to most programming languages. These data structures work efficiently due to the use of a hash function which generates an **index** for quickly accessing values linked to keys. Think of it like a phone book, where you can quickly flip to the desired pages using alphabetical sorting. For this indexing to work, keys point to a static space in memory and can't be changed, otherwise the index has to be recreated. Thus, **dictionary keys must be immutable objects**.\n",
